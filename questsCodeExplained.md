## HTML
see the ID and Class named 'match___'
these can be named anything, but must match eachother for JS to work. The JS takes the ID and adds a '.' at the beginning to find the class of that name and displays that content. Could be named the same as title, without spaces

In this next example they are both named quest 1 âœ…
<img src="img/brelaCode2.png">

<span><img src='https://placehold.it/150/ff8300/ff8300?text=.listItem'></span> is the class name given to all items on left that get colored on hover/ click (named Title of Quest 1 - 5 currently )

<span><img src='https://placehold.it/150/ff8300/ff8300?text=.displayContent'></span> is what shows up in the large section on the screen when you click the listItem

* if you copy then paste the commented out template, you have to comment out that line (see blue arrow in 1st pic), and (see title commented out 2nd pic)
    * this commented out title helps keep each section separated nicely once there is lots of content in each section

## CSS ##

* anything with kyu in the name will probably be renamed

* to get rid of line that separates listItems for last list item, :last-child wasn't working for some reason, so .listItem.last is used to remove that line. 
    * make sure the last item to the bottom of kyu section has .last unless someone can figure out the :last-child problem there

## JS ##

* the 'stick' class is used
